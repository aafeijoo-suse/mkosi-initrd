emergency.target wants vconsole-setup.service like in dracut?

shadow-utils dep in systemd.rpm

Is dbus needed? Note dbus dep in systemd.rpm.

Failures w/o dbus:
systemd-logind
systemd-homed

Note: ???

selinux: convert to dlopen? Is selinux in the initramfs useful?

shutdown?

DNF install mount /proc

Does emergency target stop sysroot.mount? It shouldn't. If we isolate
on error, that would happen. But it seems we don't, just start the
emergency target.
