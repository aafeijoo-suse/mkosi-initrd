emergency.target wants vconsole-setup.service like in dracut?

shadow-utils dep in systemd.rpm

Also:
[    2.236219] systemd-sysusers[221]: Creating group sgx with gid 994.
[    2.236598] systemd-sysusers[221]: Creating group systemd-network with gid 993.
[    2.236641] systemd-sysusers[221]: Creating user systemd-network (systemd Network Management) with uid 993 and gid 993.
[    2.237813] systemd[1]: Finished Create System Users.
Looks like we forgot to create users in scriptlets.

Is dbus needed? Note dbus dep in systemd.rpm.

Why is ldconfig.service started in the initramfs?
ConditionNeedsUpdate=|/etc
ConditionFileNotEmpty=|!/etc/ld.so.cache
Mtimes in the archive are set properly. Kernel code seems to be preserving utimes (init/initramfs.c â†’ vfs_utimes)

Failures w/o dbus:
systemd-logind
systemd-homed

Note: ???

selinux: convert to dlopen? Is selinux in the initramfs useful?

shutdown?

DNF install mount /proc

Does emergency target stop sysroot.mount? It shouldn't. If we isolate
on error, that would happen. But it seems we don't, just start the
emergency target.
